## üåü Key Features & Improvements

This application has evolved to include a wide array of functionalities, making it a powerful tool for various email needs:

### **Core Email Generation**

* **Contextual Email Generation:** Provide keywords or a brief context, and the AI will generate a full, coherent email draft.

* **Scenario/Template Selector:** Choose from 50+ pre-defined email scenarios (e.g., Meeting Request, Job Application Follow-up, Sales Pitch, Apology Email) across professional, casual, marketing, internal, support, recruitment, event, announcement, educational, and personal categories. Selecting a scenario pre-populates the subject and context for a quick start.

* **Language Selection:** Generate emails in multiple languages (English, Spanish, French, German, Japanese, Mandarin, Arabic, Portuguese, Italian, Korean, Russian).

### **Customization & Control**

* **Expanded Tone Selection:** Choose from a wide range of predefined tones (Professional, Friendly, Urgent, Empathetic, Persuasive, Concise, Casual, Formal, Humorous, Sarcastic, Direct) or define a completely custom tone.

* **Email Length Control:** Specify the desired length for the generated email (Short, Medium, or Long) to control verbosity.

* **Key Phrases/Keywords to Include:** Add specific words, phrases, or names that *must* be incorporated into the generated email.

* **Customizable Call-to-Action (CTA):** Define a specific call-to-action that the AI should clearly include in the email (e.g., "Please schedule a call," "Review the attached document by Friday").

* **Attachment Mention:** Instruct the AI to mention planned attachments by name, ensuring phrases like "Please find attached..." are naturally integrated.

* **Sender Information:** Include optional fields for your name and title/company to personalize the email's closing signature.

### **Reply & Analysis Features**

* **"Reply to an Existing Email" Mode:** Toggle a mode where you can paste the content of an original email. The AI will then generate a contextual reply based on your instructions.

* **Content Summarization (for Reply Mode):** With a click, summarize the pasted original email to quickly grasp its key points and action items.

* **Sentiment Analysis (for Reply Mode):** Automatically analyze and display the sentiment (Positive, Neutral, Negative, Mixed) of the original email, helping you tailor your reply's tone.

### **Usability & Workflow Enhancements**

* **Generated Email History:** Stores the last 5 generated email drafts within the current session, allowing you to review and compare previous outputs.

* **Clear All Inputs Button:** Conveniently placed at both the top and bottom of the input form to reset all fields and start fresh.

* **Scroll to Generated Email:** The page automatically scrolls down to the generated email section once a draft is produced, improving user flow.

* **Generated Word Count Display:** Provides an instant word count for the generated email, helping you meet length requirements.

* **Iterative Prompt Refinement:** After an email is generated, you can provide additional instructions to refine it further, making the iteration process seamless.

### **Advanced AI Control**

* **Custom AI Parameters:** Fine-tune the AI's behavior with sliders for "Creativity (Temperature)" and a number input for "Max Output Tokens," giving power users more control over the generated content's style and length.

* **Dynamic Placeholders:** The AI is instructed to use generic placeholders (e.g., `[Recipient's Name]`, `[Meeting Date]`) when specific details are not provided, making the drafts easily customizable.

## üõ†Ô∏è How It Was Built

* **Frontend & Backend (Python Web App):** [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/)

* **AI Model:** [Google Gemini API](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api) (`gemini-2.0-flash` model)

* **HTTP Requests:** `requests` Python library

* **Styling:** Custom CSS (leveraging some Tailwind-like principles for a clean, modern look).

## üöÄ How to Run Locally

To get this AI Email Assistant running on your local machine:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    If you haven't already, clone this GitHub repository to your local machine:

    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/haystackz12/ai-email-assistant.git](https://github.com/haystackz12/ai-email-assistant.git)
    cd ai-email-assistant
    ```

2.  **Create a virtual environment (recommended):**
    This isolates your project dependencies.

    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    # On Windows:
    .\venv\Scripts\activate
    # On macOS/Linux:
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

3.  **Install dependencies:**
    Install the required Python libraries using pip:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

    (Ensure `requirements.txt` contains `streamlit` and `requests`).

4.  **Set up your Google Gemini API Key:**

    * Obtain your API key from [Google AI Studio](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey).

    * In your project's root directory (`ai-email-assistant`), create a folder named `.streamlit` (if it doesn't exist):

        ```bash
        mkdir .streamlit
        ```

    * Inside the `.streamlit` folder, create a file named `secrets.toml`:

        ```bash
        touch .streamlit/secrets.toml
        ```

    * Open `secrets.toml` with a text editor and add your API key in the following format:

        ```toml
        GOOGLE_API_KEY="YOUR_ACTUAL_GEMINI_API_KEY_HERE"
        ```

        **Important:** Replace `"YOUR_ACTUAL_GEMINI_API_KEY_HERE"` with your actual key, keeping the quotation marks.
        **Security Note:** It's crucial **NOT** to commit `secrets.toml` to your public GitHub repository. Ensure `.streamlit/secrets.toml` is listed in your `.gitignore` file.

5.  **Run the Streamlit app:**

    ```bash
    streamlit run app.py
    ```

    Your web browser should automatically open the application, usually at `http://localhost:8501`.

## üí° Understanding the Output

The generated email drafts will adapt based on all the inputs you provide (context, tone, length, key phrases, CTA, attachments, language, and sender info).

* **Structure:** Emails typically follow a standard format: Salutation, Body, Closing, and Signature.

* **Placeholders:** If your context doesn't provide specific details for things like names, dates, or project names, the AI is designed to use clear placeholders (e.g., `[Recipient's Name]`, `[Meeting Date]`) that you can easily fill in manually.

* **Copying:** Use the "Copy Email Content to Clipboard" button to quickly transfer the AI-generated email body (excluding the To/Subject lines you entered) to your clipboard for pasting into your email client.

## üöÄ Future Enhancements (Conceptual)

While already powerful, here are some ideas for how this assistant could evolve:

* **Direct Calendar Integration:** Implement a "Schedule Meeting" button that uses no-code automation platforms (like Zapier or Make) to create calendar events in Google Calendar, Outlook Calendar, etc., based on the email content.

* **Draft Sending (via API):** Integrate with email service APIs (e.g., SendGrid, Mailgun) to allow sending drafted emails directly from the app (requires more complex authentication and scope).

* **Email Template Saving:** Allow users to save their own custom scenarios or preferred configurations as reusable templates.
