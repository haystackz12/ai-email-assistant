    * Create a folder named `.streamlit` in your project's root directory: `mkdir .streamlit`
    * Inside `.streamlit`, create a file named `secrets.toml`: `touch .streamlit/secrets.toml`
    * Open `secrets.toml` and add your API key:
        ```toml
        GOOGLE_API_KEY="YOUR_ACTUAL_GEMINI_API_KEY_HERE"

## ‚öôÔ∏è API Key

This application uses the Google Gemini API. When deployed on platforms like Streamlit Community Cloud, the API key is typically handled securely as a secret. For local development, it's read from `.streamlit/secrets.toml`. **Do NOT commit your `secrets.toml` file to GitHub.** Add `.streamlit/secrets.toml` to your `.gitignore` file if you haven't already.
